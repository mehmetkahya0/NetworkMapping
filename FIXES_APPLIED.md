# Network Mapping Tool - Fixes Applied

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing `simple_main.py` File
**Issue**: The main import `from simple_main import SimpleNetworkMapper` was failing because the file didn't exist.

**Fix**: Created a complete `simple_main.py` file with the `SimpleNetworkMapper` class that includes:
- Network discovery using ping
- Port scanning capabilities 
- Device classification
- Network graph building
- Data export functionality
- Configuration file support

### 2. Incomplete GUI Implementation
**Issue**: The `gui.py` file had truncated/incomplete methods, particularly `generate_map()` and `export_data()`.

**Fix**: Completed all missing method implementations:
- Fixed `generate_map()` method with proper file dialog and error handling
- Fixed `export_data()` method with file dialog functionality
- Fixed missing lines in `scan_network()` method
- Added proper error handling throughout

### 3. Import and Syntax Issues
**Issue**: Various import issues and missing dependencies.

**Fix**: 
- Ensured all required imports are properly handled
- Added fallback error handling for missing GUI libraries
- Fixed configuration file loading with proper error handling

### 4. Configuration Integration
**Issue**: The config.ini file wasn't being used by the application.

**Fix**: Integrated configuration file support in `SimpleNetworkMapper`:
- Port scanning configuration
- Visualization settings (colors, sizes)
- Thread and timeout settings
- Export preferences

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `simple_main.py` - Main network mapping class with complete implementation
- `test_fixes.py` - Test suite to verify all fixes work correctly

### Modified Files
- `gui.py` - Fixed incomplete methods and added proper error handling
- No changes needed to: `main.py`, `interactive.py`, `config.ini`, `requirements.txt`

## Verification

All fixes have been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ All imports work properly
- ✅ GUI creates successfully 
- ✅ Network detection works
- ✅ Gateway detection functions
- ✅ Configuration loading works
- ✅ All command-line and GUI versions are functional

## How to Use

The tool now offers multiple interfaces:

1. **Simple Version**: `python simple_main.py`
   - Quick network scan and basic results
   - Good for testing functionality

2. **Full Command Line**: `python main.py` 
   - Complete network scan with visualization
   - Exports data and generates network map

3. **Interactive Menu**: `python interactive.py`
   - Menu-driven interface
   - Step-by-step network mapping

4. **GUI Version**: `python gui.py`
   - User-friendly graphical interface
   - Point-and-click network scanning

## Dependencies

All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:
```
networkx==3.1
matplotlib==3.7.1
netifaces==0.11.0
requests==2.31.0
```

Install with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Testing

To verify everything works after applying fixes:
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

This will test all imports, basic functionality, and GUI creation.
